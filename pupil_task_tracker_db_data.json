Literature gives you the safety of travelling within the comforts of your own home, with a cup of tea in your hand and a cat sitting on your lap. I would like to take you on a journey through Great Britain. You can stay exactly where you are: no passport needed, no flight necessary, just an eagerness to explore. Through thesenovels you will be able to transport yourself and discover the beauty and the culture of Great Britain.",

This book is excellent for English learners because of the simple language and diverse vocabulary. I recommend this book for people who want a larger knowledge of English vocabulary in particular.
